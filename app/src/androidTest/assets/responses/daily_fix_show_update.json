  "description": "On today’s IGN The Fix: Games,Former EA CEO John Riccitiello has spoken up about microtransactions in video games, saying what while those who avoid implementing monetization early on in the creative process are some of the &quot;most beautiful and pure, brilliant people,&quot; they are also &quot;some of the biggest f****** idiots.&quot;The NPD Group has revealed that Elden Ring was the best-selling game of June here in the US. Per the NPD Group, the original statement in its report was based on an &quot;incomplete data set,&quot; which analyst Mat Piscatella elaborated on Twitter as not including the full history for all titles and platforms across physical and digital. As such, the group does not have enough information to conclude that Elden Ring was one of the top 10 best-selling premium games in US history.San Diego Comic Con is next week and IGN has everything you need to experience the con from the comfort of your own home! Let us know what you are looking forward to at San Diego Comic Con in the comments below.Narz has it all on today’s Daily Fix!",
